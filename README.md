#Book Search App
This is a simple React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API and maintain a personal bookshelf in the browser using localStorage.
Setup
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Node.js: Download Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js, but you can update it separately by running npm install -g npm.
Usage 
Use the search bar to search for books by their title.
Click on the "Search" button to fetch search results in real-time.
Add books from the search results to your personal bookshelf by clicking the "Add to Bookshelf" button on each book card.
View your personal bookshelf by navigating to the "My Bookshelf" page.
On the bookshelf page, remove books by clicking the "Remove from Bookshelf" button on each book card.
